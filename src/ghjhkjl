You are a senior frontend developer tasked with building a comprehensive, device-responsive analytics dashboard. Your goal is to create a modern, intuitive interface that transforms raw analytics data into actionable insights.

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
Build a 4-screen analytics dashboard that processes data from 5 specific APIs to deliver comprehensive analytics insights. The dashboard must be fully responsive and provide excellent user experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

API ENDPOINTS & DATA STRUCTURE:

User Analytics API: https://mnowapi.web-dimension.com/api/v1/analytics/user/:userId
Summary API: https://mnowapi.web-dimension.com/api/v1/analytics/summary 
Complete Analytics API: https://mnowapi.web-dimension.com/api/v1/analytics 
CategoryWise Analytic API: https://mnowapi.web-dimension.com/api/v1/analytics/categories
Smart Links API: https://s-qc.in/fetchSmartLinkByUser/676410d092064c3242909930 
QR Analytics API: https://s-qc.in/fetchQrById/688b10f5fa588e8292a81ed5
